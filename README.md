## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the **Digital Business Card** project! 🌟

A **Digital Business Card** is an electronic version of a traditional business card, designed to share your contact information and professional details in a modern, convenient format. Unlike a physical card, it can be easily shared via the web and customized as needed.

This project is a **static page** built with React, created as part of my ongoing practice to sharpen my React skills.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to put my React skills to the test by building a functional and stylish digital business card. This project allowed me to:

- 🛠️ **Create Reusable Custom Components:** I focused on building modular components that can be reused throughout the project, promoting code efficiency and consistency.

- 🔍 **Master JSX Syntax:** I gained hands-on experience with JSX, the syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML elements directly in your JavaScript code.

- 🎨 **Organize and Style Components:** Structuring the components logically and applying custom styles were key aspects of this project, ensuring that the final product is both user-friendly and visually appealing.

## 🎨 Figma Integration

A unique aspect of this project was the integration of a design from **Figma**. This involved:

- ✨ **Learning Figma:** I explored Figma, a leading design tool, to understand how to interpret and utilize design files effectively.

- 🧩 **Bringing Design to Life:** I translated the Figma design into a working React application, ensuring that the digital business card closely mirrors the original design with precision and attention to detail.

## 🧪 Testing My React Skills

This project was a comprehensive test of my React capabilities, allowing me to:

- **Apply core concepts:** From component creation to JSX, I utilized the core features of React to build this project.
- **Improve my design-to-code workflow:** By working directly from a Figma design, I honed my ability to translate design mockups into fully functional code.
- **Enhance my styling techniques:** Styling in React can be challenging, but this project provided valuable experience in organizing and applying styles effectively.
